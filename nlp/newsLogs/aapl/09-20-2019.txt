the booming smartwatch market is helping drive soaring shipments in the broader wearables market. apple (nasdaq: aapl) continues to lead the way with its category-defining apple watch, which all competing smartwatches are inevitably measured against. "compared to the rest of the smartwatch market, the apple watch series 5 is in a completely different league," the verge writes in its review of the latest iteration.
rumors continue to swirl that alphabet (nasdaq: goog) (nasdaq: googl) subsidiary google has a pixel watch in the works. however, the search behemoth might have actually killed off the gadget years ago.
business insider reports that google hardware chief rick osterloh actually axed the first-party smartwatch back in 2016, shortly before the company's "made by google" hardware event in october of that year. google unveiled its first generation of pixel phones and google home smart speakers at that event.
osterloh had just been named head of google's nascent hardware business a few months prior, and shuttered numerous initiatives including project ara, which was exploring modular phones, according to the report. google had partnered with lg to manufacture its smartwatch, but osterloh was reportedly dissatisfied with the device's aesthetic, as well as its functionality. lg would proceed to release the smartwatches under its own brand in 2017.
perhaps most importantly, no pixel watch is expected to be unveiled this year, according to bi's sources. earlier this week, google announced its hardware event is scheduled for oct. 15.
the report makes google's acquisition of smartwatch tech from fossil for $40 million in january seem bizarre. that deal included intellectual property (ip) that the accessory maker was working on, as well as part of fossil's r&d team. fossil has been one of google's most consistent and loyal wear os partners, and watches are the consumer discretionary company's biggest segment.
"the addition of fossil group's technology and team to google demonstrates our commitment to the wearables industry by enabling a diverse portfolio of smartwatches and supporting the ever-evolving needs of the vitality-seeking, on-the-go consumer," wear os chief stacey burr said in a statement at the time.
why would google scoop up smartwatch ip if it wasn't building a pixel watch? it was never clear what kind of ip the company acquired, but it's worth noting that google again changed strategic course in hardware just two months later when it reportedly started ramping down its tablet and laptop efforts. osterloh subsequently confirmed that his team was bailing on tablets but still pushing forward with laptops.
some articles have made this a bit unclear so wanted to clarify. and of course we will fully support pixel slate for the long-term as well.
wear os has largely been supplanted by other platforms, including samsung's tizen and fitbit's fitbitos, so maybe it's better for google to sit this one out.

shares of roku (nasdaq:) officially entered bear market territory yesterday, dropping over 20% from the recent highs at the $170 area. but the red-hot rally that took roku stock to such lofty levels was arguably way overdone. and in a similar fashion, the unrelenting selling in roku stock is getting a little overdone as well.
 what all that means is that it's time to position to be a buyer of roku on any further weakness.
the competition in the fiercely competitive streaming space just got taken up a notch yesterday, leading to yet another plunge in the roku stock price. comcast (nasdaq:) announced it will give a free streaming box to current subscribers, while facebook (nasdaq:) introduced portal tv.
this follows on the heels of such heavyweights as apple (nasdaq:), disney (nyse:) and amazon making a move into internet media. while competing with the big boys can certainly crimp margins, roku does have the first mover advantage. over 1/3 of all smart tvs now come with roku already installed.
 upped his price target yesterday from $119 to $180, citing under-appreciated international growth opportunities. he also noted that roku is in a rare win-win-win-win arrangement with hardware manufacturers, consumers, content providers and advertisers. although the upgrade was ill-timed given the massive drop in roku stock, the long-term thesis still remains valid.
it's important to also remember that . the company reported an earnings loss of 8 cents, much better than expectations for a loss of 23 cents. revenues were also presentable, coming in at $250 million versus the $225 million analyst consensus. roku also raised its full-year guidance. the recent carnage in roku stock, however, has all but wiped out the gains made post earnings.
roku is looking decidedly oversold from a technical perspective. its 5-day rsi is now below 20 and at levels that have signaled a significant low in the past. its macd just reached the lowest reading of the year. downside momentum is getting extremely bearish, while bollinger percent b is nearing negative. meanwhile, roku stock held the 50-day moving average, while the 100-day average of $108.58 should provide additional downside support.
roku saw some unusual option activity as well yesterday. nearly 4,500 sep 27 $140 calls traded versus only 261 open interest. this type of aggressive call buying likely means some big-time player is positioning for a pop in the roku stock price.
the huge drop in roku yesterday -- nearly 14% -- also drove up implied volatility. this means option prices are more expensive, favoring selling strategies when constructing trades. so to position to be a buyer of roku at even lower levels, an out-of-the-money bull put spread makes strategic sense.
buy the roku nov $95 put and sell the roku nov $100 put for a $1 net credit.
the maximum gain on the trade is $100 per spread with maximum risk of $400 per spread. return on risk is 25%. and the short $100 strike price provides a 23% downside cushion to the $123.98 closing price of roku stock.

the atlantic magazine's had a story about how american companies are spending trillions on stock buybacks to enrich their ceos. much of the article's content has been covered extensively by business media -- both the pros and cons -- so i won't rehash the arguments. however, one of author jerry useem's paragraphs bears repeating because it hits at the core of the problem.
"corporations describe the practice as an efficient way to return money to shareholders," useem wrote. "by reducing the number of shares outstanding in the market, a buyback lifts the price of each remaining share. but that spike is often short-lived: a study by the research firm fortuna advisors found that, five years out, the stocks of companies that engaged in heavy buybacks performed worse for shareholders than the stocks of companies that didn't."
i've always believed that if a company wants to allocate its free cash flow to shareholders, it should do so by paying a special dividend, not by repurchasing shares or paying a regular dividend. stock buybacks distort earnings growth while regular quarterly dividends ratchet up shareholder expectations. neither is good for the long-term health of a business. but it's especially galling when stock buybacks enrich a ceo at the expense of the rank-and-file employees.
love them or hate them, these 10 companies are making their ceos rich.

comcast's (nasdaq: cmcsa) nbc recently offered details about its intentions to jump on the video streaming bandwagon through peacock, a platform that will feature over 15,000 hours of content when it arrives next april. peacock will be offered as a free ad-supported service for comcast's u.s. customers, with paid tiers for ad-free viewing and non-comcast subscribers.
comcast hasn't revealed any prices yet, but it stated that peacock will be the exclusive streaming platform for the office (which will leave netflix (nasdaq: nflx) in 2021), parks and recreation, and reboots and revivals of classic shows like saved by the bell, battlestar galactica, and punky brewster. it will also offer access to classic nbc shows like 30 rock, everybody loves raymond, frasier, saturday night live, and its catalog of universal movies.
comcast's move into the streaming market isn't surprising, since most of its media rivals are implementing similar strategies. however, peacock's launch seems shoddily conceived for three simple reasons.
unlike apple (nasdaq: aapl), disney (nyse: dis), and amazon (nasdaq: amzn), which branded their video services clearly by adding a "plus" or "video" to their names, nbc decided to name its entire service after its six-decade-old logo.
the lack of "nbc" or "universal" in its name is confusing enough, but the "peacock" brand is already being widely roasted across social media for sharing a name with katy perry's 2010 song -- which was loaded with racy double entendres. i'm pretty sure that's not the response nbc's marketing team was looking for.
netflix has 158.8 million viewers in the u.s., according to emarketer. it's followed by amazon, with 96.5 million; disney's hulu, with 75.8 million; and at&t's (nyse: t) hbo now, with 23.1 million viewers. each of these market leaders has distinct advantages.
netflix has a first mover's advantage in the market. amazon offers prime video as a perk for prime subscribers, which topped 100 million in the u.s. at the end of 2018, according to cirp.
disney will bundle hulu with disney+ and espn+ in a $13-per-month package this november, and at&t plans to bundle its hbo and warnermedia content together in hbo max next spring. apple will also launch apple tv+ this november.
by the time comcast finally launches peacock, the market will be even more saturated with rivals, all of which will be launching high-budget original shows to lock in subscribers. it's hard to see peacock standing out in that crowded market.
peacock's lineup of shows and movies looks decent, but it arguably lacks the punch of disney's lineup of original marvel and star wars shows, amazon's $1 billion lord of the rings series, and apple tv+'s lineup of original content from stars like steven spielberg and oprah winfrey.
nbc doesn't even hold the streaming rights to friends, which at&t's warnermedia recently outbid from netflix in a $425 million five-year deal. nbc also doesn't hold the streaming rights to seinfeld, which were claimed by netflix for over $500 million for five years.
the lack of those two classic nbc comedies, which would attract a lot of nostalgic gen x viewers, would likely throttle peacock's growth. to make matters worse, warnermedia also recently secured the exclusive streaming rights to the big bang theory for an undisclosed price.
nbcuniversal's revenue fell 7% annually during the first half of 2019. the unit, which accounted for 40% of comcast's sales, struggled with a 17% drop in broadcast tv revenue and a 4% decline in its cable revenue.
that decline was mainly caused by tough year-over-year comparisons to the olympics and super bowl last year. excluding those prior-year gains, its broadcast revenue improved 4%, and its cable revenue rose 3%.
those numbers aren't bad, but its growth could decelerate as more viewers cut their cords and get locked in by single streaming platforms. moreover, at&t, which competes against comcast in the isp market, is bundling its streaming services with its internet plans.
to counter those headwinds, comcast is leveraging its position as one of the top isps in the u.s. to launch peacock as a free bonus for its subscribers. that's the same reason it recently started offering xfinity flex, a streaming platform for over 10,000 movies and shows which previously cost $5 a month, as a free bonus for its internet subscribers. flex will also support peacock when it arrives next year.
peacock is more of a defensive play for comcast instead of an offensive move aimed at netflix, amazon, apple, or disney. however, playing defense might not be enough to keep viewers from tuning out -- especially with its awkward branding, late arrival, and lack of compelling exclusive or original content.

the race to $1 trillion in market capitalization has been well documented, as some of the nation's biggest technology companies have flirted with that milestone in the past 18 months.
apple (nasdaq: aapl) was the first to achieve it in early august 2018, flirted with the artificial milestone through november 2018, but then fell in value before hitting the mark again in the middle of last week. apple is hoping this one lasts a little longer. shares for the tech giant quickly came under pressure in the days that followed, as investors and analysts digested all the information from apple's product launch on sept. 10, and the price dipped. but the stock is back up again and the market cap is now hovering right around $1 trillion. so what's behind the rise and fall and rise again of apple's market cap in such a short time frame? for years now apple has chosen early september as the time to roll out new products and services. after all, the holidays are mere months away, and who doesn't want a new iphone or ipad as a gift?
but apple also used this year's event in the steve jobs theater at the company's cupertino, california, headquarters to tout its upcoming streaming-content service apple tv+, and its gaming service apple arcade. to stand out from the growing number of competitors, it announced a $4.99 monthly subscription fee for both services. it also said that if you buy a new apple device you get a one-year subscription to apple tv+ for free. that was well received by the legions of fans who attended the event in person or watched a live stream of the event.
add the iphone 11, the iphone 11 pro, and the iphone 11 pro max to the mix, and you can't blame investors for getting giddy. with iphone sales becoming sluggish here and in china, giving consumers reasons to upgrade is important to apple's finances. it didn't hurt that the basic version of the iphone 11 is priced at $699, lower than previous iphone launches. one of the knocks on apple is that its iphones are simply too pricey; consumers are less inclined to throw down $1,000 or more for a mobile device unless it gives them a completely new experience.
apple also unveiled a new ipad, an upgraded ipados (operating system), and the next version of the apple watch. all these devices have advanced technology, longer battery lives, and eye-catching colors and designs. enthusiasm around its new devices and services sent shares of apple climbing, and it's market cap followed suit, rising above the $1 trillion mark.
but then on friday, sept. 13, goldman sachs' analysts weighed in, and some of that euphoria dissipated. in a research note reported on by marketwatch, analyst rod hall cut his price target on apple to $165 from $187 and maintained his neutral rating. the reason for his move: apple tv+.
the way the analyst sees it, apple is making a big mistake by pricing its content service at $4.99 a month; he argues that it will hurt earnings. he said the one-year free trial will lower the average selling prices (asps) for apple's devices, and thus its margins, even if it achieves higher services revenue.
"effectively, apple's method of accounting moves revenue from hardware to services even though customers do not perceive themselves to be paying for tv+," hall wrote in the research note to clients. "though this might appear convenient for apple's services revenue line, it is equally inconvenient for both apparent hardware asps and margins in high sales quarter[s]," like the upcoming holiday quarter (the first quarter of fiscal 2020). the analyst warned fiscal q1 earnings results could be "materially" lower than forecast.
apple quickly pushed back on that assessment, saying in a statement to cnbc that the pricing of apple tv+, including the one-year free trial, won't have a material impact on its financial results.
apple's response appears to have been enough to calm some nervous investors. as of wednesday morning, apple's market cap stands right around $1 billion with shares trading at $221.64. it's still the second-highest-valued tech company behind microsoft, with a market cap of $1.05 trillion; amazon is a distant third, with a market value of $900 billion.
while reaching $1 trillion in market capitalization makes for good headlines and dinner party conversations, in the grand scheme of things it's nothing more than an artificial milestone. consider the case of u.s. steel, for example. around the turn of the 20th century, it was the first company to achieve a market capitalization of more than $1 billion. but in the decades following that milestone, a slew of companies achieved much higher market capitalizations and have far surpassed it. apple will forever be known as the first company to reach $1 trillion in market cap, but if consumers aren't buying its future products and consuming its services, it won't matter too much if once upon a time it was valued so richly.

snapchat isn't exactly a reliable source of hard-hitting news, but parent company snap (nyse: snap) reportedly wants to change that. the disappearing-message company is in talks with media companies to develop content for a dedicated news tab on snapchat, separate from the existing discover tab, according to a report from the information. discover is chock-full of celebrity gossip and entertainment videos, but not the kind of news people consider "news."
facebook (nasdaq: fb), meanwhile, is working to court publishers to its dedicated tab, which it plans to hold up as a source for "trustworthy news." about two-thirds of americans already get their news from social media, according to a pew research poll from last year. facebook is by far the most popular social media source; 43% of all americans use it to get news. just 5% use snapchat for news.
facebook is reportedly struggling to get big-name publishers onboard with its plans, but snap may have better success due to the demographics of its audience.
facebook's offering publishers up to $3 million for the rights to republish articles in its dedicated news section. that amount could be a big deal to a small publisher of a local newspaper. facebook will help smaller publications reach a broader audience and pay them for the privilege, no less. what's more, facebook's efforts may give publishers more leverage to get other tech companies looking to get into news distribution, like apple, to pay up, as well.
for a big national news publisher, however, the deal isn't as sweet. first of all, the dollar amount isn't as significant to a bigger company. second of all, the marginal gain over not participating in facebook's news section isn't as significant for a well-known brand. additionally, the publisher would be ceding some control of its brand to facebook, which will be able to place content from a national publisher next to any other content in the ecosystem. big publishers had similar objections to apple's new distribution services, apple tv channels and apple news+.
snap doesn't provide any panacea for those same challenges. it does, however, open the door to an audience that's often harder to reach and less easily monetized through subscriptions -- i.e., young people. that may make certain sacrifices worth it for the bigger publishers pushing back against facebook.
younger people have shown an interest in more mainstream news when it's packaged differently from the nightly half hour on local broadcast television. snapchat provides a suitable distribution platform for the snackable video news content they most prefer.
while snap may have a stronger pitch to media companies than facebook, thanks to its relative audience, it's proven quite incapable of changing its users' behaviors. (remember, just 5% of americans presently get news from snapchat.) the app redesign last year that intended to "separate the social from the media" mostly succeeded in separating users from snapchat.
many of snap's discover partners were hurt by the redesign. that said, snap has had a lot of success recently with snap originals, which continue to see increased viewership. snap may want news publishers to create new content specifically for snapchat like snap originals. that would have a greater chance of attracting an audience but also cost a considerable amount more for snap upfront. snap is paying between $40,000 and $50,000 per episode of snap originals. that's relatively manageable when each series has around 10 episodes. news content comes out every day, multiple times per day, and it doesn't have the same watchability just a few days after its release.
and while facebook can easily give $100 million to a few dozen news publishers for an experimental news section, that kind of money is harder to come by at snap. the company's free cash flow came in at negative $103 million last quarter, compared to $4.8 billion at facebook.
getting all the ingredients together to succeed with a dedicated news tab is a bigger challenge for snap than simply attracting media companies to publish their content on the platform. on the other hand, if facebook can sign a few big-name publishers to its dedicated news tab, it's well-positioned to get users to engage more on the platform by offering both better news content and a better user experience than most digital news readers are used to.

apple (nasdaq: aapl) confirmed pricing and availability for apple tv+ and apple arcade last week. both services will cost $5 per month and can be shared within a family, but that's about where the strategic similarities end. apple arcade launches this thursday, while apple tv+ debuts on nov. 1. the company is taking very different approaches with the services, in part because each one is entering dramatically different markets.
apple has reportedly boosted its original content budget for apple tv+ to a whopping $6 billion, significantly more than the $500 million that the tech giant is investing in its mobile gaming service. yet the mac maker is giving away a free year of apple tv+ to customers that buy hardware, while apple arcade has no such promotion. for those not in the market for a new apple device, apple tv+ will have a seven-day free trial, much shorter than apple arcade's one-month free trial.
in other words, apple is willing to forego recouping its much larger investment in apple tv+ content but wants apple arcade subscribers to open their wallets sooner. the disparity all traces back to the company's relative strength in those respective markets.
apple knows it's coming from behind in video streaming, and the service's value proposition won't stack up favorably next to competing services. the streaming wars are only going to get more intensely competitive over the next year. that's why the tech titan needs to get aggressive with pricing, undercutting many rivals but also offering a far smaller catalog of tv shows and movies.
in contrast, apple is a dominant player in mobile gaming, which accounts for an estimated 74% of mobile consumer spending. consumer spending on mobile gaming is now 20% larger than all other gaming formats combined, and ios monetizes at much stronger levels than android. however, many of the business practices in mobile gaming have devolved to what many critics consider to be predatory, particularly as they relate to children.
the mobile gaming industry is now dominated by freemium titles that monetize with in-app purchases and microtransactions, all while displaying an excessive number of ads for other games that monetize with in-app purchases and microtransactions. it's an endless cycle. apple has faced numerous lawsuits from upset parents over enabling such practices, while simultaneously grappling with accusations that its devices are too addictive.
apple arcade hopes to address those pitfalls. none of the included titles will have ads or in-app purchases, and apple arcade has the potential to improve the underlying economics of mobile games while securing exclusive high-quality titles in order to build its services business. unlike apple tv+'s relatively sparse catalog, apple arcade will launch with over 100 titles.
in mobile gaming, apple is coming from a position of strength while offering a compelling value proposition, so it doesn't need to be nearly as aggressive.

at&t's (nyse: t) warnermedia, which holds the cable syndication rights to the big bang theory via its subsidiary tbs, recently secured the exclusive domestic streaming rights to the hit comedy. the five-year streaming deal, which includes a renewal of tbs' cable syndication rights through 2028, is reportedly worth over $1 billion.
warnermedia plans to stream the big bang theory exclusively on hbo max, its upcoming streaming bundle that merges hbo's content with warnermedia's shows and movies.
this isn't the first big deal for warnermedia -- hbo recently paid $425 million to pull the streaming rights for friends from netflix (nasdaq: nflx) for the next five years, and signed a $250 million deal with j.j. abrams' bad robot to produce exclusive shows and films.
these megadeals indicate that at&t is getting serious about challenging netflix, walt disney (nyse: dis), apple (nasdaq: aapl), amazon.com (nasdaq: amzn), and others in the streaming race -- but is the big bang theory really worth $1 billion?
at&t's streaming business is currently fragmented across seven main services.
at&t tv now (formerly directv now) streams directv's satellite channels and offers cloud dvr storage, while a contract-only version, called at&t tv, is bundled with internet plans and a set-top box. hbo go streams hbo content for cable subscribers, while its twin, hbo now, doesn't require a cable subscription.
hbo max adds warnermedia content to hbo's lineup, while watchtv streams only warnermedia's cable channels. dc universe, a legacy project from time warner before at&t's takeover, offers dc-themed shows, movies, and digital comics.
the monthly fees for the non-contract services are all over the map, and likely a source of confusion for at&t's salespeople, customers, and investors:
data source: company websites; prices current as of sept. 18, 2019.
none of these services is competitively priced. netflix's standard plan costs $13 per month, disney's upcoming bundle (which includes disney+, hulu, and espn+) also costs $13, apple tv+ will cost $5, and amazon prime video (which is included in prime subscriptions) costs $9 a month on a stand-alone basis.
at&t seems to think that hbo and warnermedia's content is strong enough to justify its higher prices, but that could be tough since netflix, disney, apple, and amazon are all producing dozens of high-budget original shows and movies. that's why it's spending so much money to lock in friends and the big bang theory.
the big bang theory, which ran for 12 seasons, between 2007 and 2019, attracted an average of 17.3 million viewers in its final season and was the most-watched scripted series on tv. that massive audience guarantees that the show's move to hbo max will attract some subscribers.
however, it's still unclear if the big bang theory will have the staying power of comedies like friends and seinfeld. if it does, hbo max will gain another way to lock in viewers alongside shows like game of thrones, friends, and the fresh prince of bel-air. but if it doesn't, at&t might realize that it would have been smarter to spend that cash on original content.
hbo max already announced a beefy lineup of original shows like dune: the sisterhood, a spin-off of the sci-fi classic dune; the nicole kidman-produced crime farm; and the flight attendant, a mystery series starring the big bang theory's kaley cuoco -- but they all face tough, high-budget challengers on rival platforms.
therefore, it arguably makes more sense for warnermedia to produce fresh content instead of buying reruns of popular comedies. amazon, for example, is spending $1 billion to produce five seasons of its upcoming lord of the rings series, and about $7 billion annually on both streaming video and music content.
disney plans to spend $1 billion on original content by 2020, then up to $2 billion by 2024, to expand its marvel, star wars, and other franchises across its streaming platforms. apple plans to spend $6 billion on original content for apple tv+, while netflix is spending about $15 billion annually on licensed and original content.
at&t secured the bulk of hbo and warnermedia's content with its $85 billion takeover of time warner, but it can't grow complacent and expect reruns of popular shows like the big bang theory to help it keep pace with its rivals.
at&t's streaming strategy is still confusing, its platforms aren't competitively priced, and it arguably lacks fresh content that could give it an edge against netflix, amazon, disney, or apple. simply put, many customers are probably seeking out the next stranger things or the boys instead of reruns of friends or the big bang theory.

after the stock bottomed at $120 in june, microsoft corporation (nasdaq:) shares traded to new highs at $141.68. but since august, the stock is stuck in a very narrow trading range at $136. microsoft stock still is modestly high but the p/e has room to expand.
 expect microsoft to report a strong q1 report next month, following last quarter's (q4) results. in the last period, the company reported double-digit growth from all but one segment.
its intelligent cloud division year-on-year, while the more personal computing grew 4%. still, the gross margin of 15% is a 2 point improvement. at an eps of $1.71 or an annualized p/e of 19.9 times, msft stock borders on being too cheap to ignore.
investors may hunt for inexpensive technology stocks like intel (nasdaq:intc), whose p/e is 12.2 times. but intel faces elevating competitive pressures from amd (nasdaq:), so the stock reflects the uncertainties ahead.
microsoft has strong bookings growth in the commercial space. in q4, bookings grew 25%, with the commercial revenue annuity mix accounting for 90% of that total.
the software giant is in the sweet spot of enjoying recurring revenue. its commercial cloud revenue, which made microsoft $11 billion in revenue, enjoyed a gross margin of 65%.
microsoft has many growth catalysts to count on in the next quarter and in 2020. office software sales are benefiting from commercial clients signing up for office 365, and on the consumer market, revenue grew 6% in the last quarter. microsoft now has 34.8 million consumer subscribers. with the apple (nasdaq:) smartphone refresh and android suppliers like samsung and xaomi launching new devices, expect more office 365 sign-ups next year.
the intelligent cloud space enjoys even better growth. azure revenue grew 64%, which suggests microsoft is taking market share from amazon.com's (nasdaq:) aws.
although hardware sales contribute to only a small part of revenue, it too is growing. surface revenue grew 18% in q4/fy2019. microsoft will host the next .
announcing a refreshed surface, one year after the last launch and ahead of the holidays may prove timely. last week, apple announced a new ipad and macbook air. microsoft may announce a surface pro 6 hybrid, an updated surface go tablet, and a surface laptop.
the windows operating system is still at the core of the company's growth ambitions. commercial markets still need new pcs every few years and a stable operating system.
as the market prepares for the end of windows 7 support, expect a surge in sales of windows 10 software. and even though surface device sales brought in $2.05 billion, down from $2.29 billion last year, look for microsoft to enjoy the hype for these products. if surface devices become the standard for the hybrid notebook and tablet form factor, it has a good chance of taking apple's ipad market share.
apple claimed 38.1% of the in the second quarter. samsung, huawei, and amazon claim the number two to four positions. microsoft is not on the list. if idc does not consider the surface as a tablet, it does not matter. microsoft needs to convince consumers and businesses to choose a surface or surface go device over an ipad for work purposes.
analysts who offer a on msft stock think the stock is worth $153.77. this is ~13% above the recent price of $136.33. various dcf ebitda and revenue exit models suggest the stock is trading at close to fair value.
it will take an uptick in revenue growth in the next quarterly report, due next month in october, to justify a higher stock price. chances are good that will happen.

if there has ever been a time for headline risk to be a sticking point for investors in netflix (nasdaq: nflx), that would probably be now. comcast (nasdaq: cmcsa) offered up some more details of its upcoming streaming service this week, and like all of the other recent unveilings, peacock is packing more of a punch than many expected. peacock -- yes, as in the iconic nbc mascot -- will launch in april. we already knew that it would be available as a premium subscription service as well as a free ad-supported platform. the latter will help it stand out against netflix, apple's (nasdaq: aapl) apple tv+, and disney's (nyse: dis) disney+, which are only available for paying customers (or in the case of apple tv+, at no additional cost for folks buying the tech giant's gadgetry). this week's peacock news centers largely around content, and comcast isn't phoning it in here. apart from the already impressive arsenal of nbc shows -- including exclusive access to the office and 30 rock -- there will be eyeball-sucking reboots of network classics including battlestar galactica and saved by the bell. comcast will also be kicking in access to films from universal pictures, dreamworks animation, and its other studios. peacock will be a force when it launches, and once again we find netflix shareholders chewing on their fingernails with the stock trading 30% below last summer's all-time high. peacock subscribers will have access to 30 rock. image source: nbcuniversal.
peacock won't be flashing all of nbc's bright and shiny feathers when it launches next spring. netflix was able to wrestle away seinfeld in a worldwide deal that will kick in come 2021. it's still clear that peacock isn't a service that can be dismissed as a competitor, a conclusion that netflix investors also came to realize when disney and apple held their media events.
disney+ wowed consumers with the breadth and pricing of its offering, and then some early adopters were able to lock in three years of the service by pre-paying what comes out to less than $4 a month. apple tv+ will be emphasizing quality over quantity with its lean but star-studded initial library, but bundling it as a freebie for a year for anyone buying an apple device will ensure that it ramps up its audience quickly.
now we have comcast's peacock, and its way to cut through the noise beyond nostalgic reboots appears to be that it will be available as a commercials-saddled version for freeloaders who don't want to pay for the premium service. it's an important distinction for peacock as the marketplace gets more crowded -- and if money gets tight should we slip into a recession.
so, yes, headline risk will weigh on netflix as we work our way through november launches of disney+ and apple tv+. we'll go through it again five months later with peacock. at some point, we'll get more details ahead of next year's launch of hbo max, and that's going to leave a mark. ahead of all of these events, we're now a little more than four weeks away from netflix's third-quarter report, which everyone will be watching given how badly it missed its subscriber target last time out. if your stomach is feeling uneasy as a netflix investor, you're probably not alone -- but you're also probably overthinking things. the market is expanding, and if anything, the arrival of apple tv+, disney+, peacock, hbo max, and whatever other new offering rolls out next will likely pull more people away from conventional linear television than from the existing streaming leaders. it's the abc and disney channel regular who will be the most smitten by disney+. it's the folks still watching nbc on its prime-time schedule who will be the most tempted to migrate online with peacock.
as scary as things seem now, these new services may be gateway drugs to get folks off their dumb tvs and onto smart tvs, where netflix will practically be a no-brainer. the headline risks are real, but investors are burying the lede if they don't realize how netflix could also be a big winner when streaming hits the masses as the default medium in the coming months. 10 stocks we like better than netflixwhen investing geniuses david and tom gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. after all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, motley fool stock advisor, has quadrupled the market.*

every investor has a method for choosing the stocks to add to their portfolio. tech stocks are a big buzzword this past decade (for good reason). whatever your experience level, there are ways to pick winning tech stocks.
here are four tips to help you pick tech stocks that will outperform the market using the methods of investing experts.
known as the monday effect, many people believe the first workday of the week is the best time for buying stocks. historically, on average, the stock market tends to drop slightly on mondays, which allows you to scoop up stocks at lower-than-usual prices. this could be due to new information and news released over the weekend or fallout from final stock prices the friday before the weekend. take advantage of other traders' lower moods or slower thinking patterns by buying stock on a monday.
if you choose monday as your day for purchasing stocks, the time of day also counts. the period between 9:30 and 11:30 est is the most active in the stock market. depending on your level of experience with the stock market, you may benefit from jumping straight in and recognizing patterns among tech stocks within the 9:30 to 10:30 period. if you have a bit less experience you can still cash in on the morning rush by trading between 10:30 and 11:30 when the market is less volatile but still moving fast. this is the time some of the best deals of the day can be had.
the weekend is a good time for investors to research prospective stocks by diving into company filings and news. this allows you to create an investing plan for monday. it helps you to avoid making spur of the moment decisions, which can backfire if you haven't done your homework about an investment.
while fine for other sectors, traditional valuation methods may fall short when it comes to tech stocks. traditional valuation methods include studying factors such as earnings per share, price to earnings ratios, growth rates, asset pricing formulas, and the roa or return on asset calculation. valuing an investment using these metrics doesn't always accurately capture the potential of fast-growing tech stocks.
look at moore's law, which says the processing power of computing chips doubles every year. tech companies must continually invest back into research and development of their products to stay ahead of the competition. to be relevant, tech companies need to keep on spending. therefore it is also possible to invest money without expecting a return right away into fledgling companies that may not yet be profitable. in this scenario, it is about the product - a great product will yield a great return. roku (nasdaq: roku) is one example - in 2018 its stock fell by 38%, while this year to date, roku has increased its earnings by a whopping 390% year-to-date, and its stock is a total of 500% since its ipo in september of 2017. remember that this advice does not follow with other industries outside of the tech sector.
while stocks vary, consider a formula such as this one from investor steve whitefoot:
company a has a market cap of 740 billion and earnings of 55 billion. now calculate the return on your investment in percent. take $55.00/$740.00 and multiply by 100, to get an annual return of 7.4%. that's earnings divided by market cap, and multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. if you are pleased with the return and feel that you can not do better with traditional methods such as the low-cost index fund s&p 500, then you may want to take the plunge and invest in the company. company a is apple. in this case, your bonds and other guaranteed investments may yield 1.5% or just over, while apple (nasdaq: aapl) gives you 7.4% for the same period.
investors often use the s&p 500 as a traditional method of valuation as a benchmark for investors to compare returns on investment.
what is the stock's primary source of revenue? if your stock is making most of its money with current technology that is being phased out, you may want to look elsewhere for a tech stock that has some staying power. if the tech stock is only earning money from building prototypes and pre-selling models, that may also be a risky investment. a tech stock company with multiple streams of income is ideal.
which industry does your potential tech stock fall into? there are many categories within technology such as it, biotech, social media, hardware, software, automotive, and semiconductors. which of these industries is growing or steady, and which may be dropping in five years? it could be that software will take a back seat to hardware, in which case you might want a tech stock in the hardware category.
the future of the company and its stock depends on the industry's growth. for example, a company making rotary dial telephones would probably be a bad investment, while one making healthcare apps for smartphones could be a good investment today.

qualcomm (nasdaq:) spent $1.15 billion to buy out the remainder of its partnership with japan-based tdk corporation (otcmkts:). this takeover probably will not offer an immediate benefit to qcom stock.
 the alliance, valued at a total of $3.1 billion, produced rf front-end filters for 4g or 5g rffe. moreover, the company faces three significant threats that likely hold down the value of qcom. however, this partnership involves one of the three factors that can help to negate these threats, and could even make qualcomm stock a buy amid intense uncertainty.
continuing lawsuits with apple (nasdaq:) has weighed on qcom stock for years. just when the company settled with apple, new legal scrutiny has come as the san diego-based chipmaker faces a judgment in its lawsuit with the federal trade commission.
for now, qualcomm has won a partial stay on enforcing the ruling. however, if qcom were to lose, they would likely have to renegotiate contracts on chipsets, possibly cutting into their profits.
secondly, china. the people's republic for qualcomm in 2018. the u.s.-china trade war certainly presents issues. to have so much of one's revenue dependent on geopolitical events beyond its control could significantly hurt revenues.
it could also lead to a potential competitor emerging if the dispute ultimately reduces or completely cuts off access in a worst-case scenario.
third, though this attracts surprisingly infrequent mention, the chart on qcom stock looks ugly. it has traded in a range that has kept it between $45 per share and $90 per share for almost nine years. at the current $78 per share, it trades toward the high end of the range. also, it has not yet surpassed the $100 per share top it saw in january 2000.
to be sure, investors need to consider both the lawsuits and the trading history when considering a position in qcom. that said, investors should also consider the positives. as discouraging as the problems appear, the reasons to overlook the issues with qcom may look even more compelling.
first, the company's multiple relative to growth. in a , i said qcom stock had a "low multiple relative to predicted 5g growth."
qualcomm has a forward price-to-earnings (pe) ratio of 18.5. despite supporting a multiple below s&p 500 averages, the profit picture looks set to improve dramatically. though profits will fall by 6% this year, a forecasted growth rate of 21.3% in 2020 should mark the beginning of an expected profit boom.
secondly, the company pays a stable, . the payout of $2.48 per share yields almost 3.2% at current prices. it has also increased every year since 2011. the increases also came every year despite the long-standing dispute with apple that kept qcom stock depressed.
the third, and probably most compelling reason involves 5g, which probably ended the legal dispute with apple. it also probably explains why .
as our own , industry analysts predict the chipset market that will hit $2.1 billion in 2020 will grow to $23 billion by 2026. that level of growth should break the $90 per share and $100 per share price ceilings on qcom stock. it could also make up for any doubts about lawsuits or china.
thanks to 5g, the positives outweigh the negatives on qcom. to be sure, the antitrust inquiry and china trade both pose threats to qualcomm. these factors remain mainly outside of the company's control. the history of the stock also implies price ceilings at both the $90- and $100-per-share levels.
however, thanks to the potential ten-plus fold growth in 5g chipsets, qcom stock should move higher even if the antitrust suit or china trade policy does not go in their favor.
moreover, qcom trades at a low valuation relative to profit growth. once the company begins to sell 5g chipsets in earnest, qualcomm stock should finally start to create new all-time highs again. furthermore, the company has proven it can maintain dividend increases even when outside forces create tremendous pressure.
when considering both the positives and negatives, qcom stock remains a buy.

there's no denying roku's (nasdaq: roku) success in the ad-supported streaming market. the company, which specializes in streaming-media players and digital advertising, has gained more than 325% this year alone. roku's pivot a couple of years back to focus on advertising was a stroke of genius and is now the most profitable segment of its business. it also made the company a must-own tech stock for 2019.
some investors abandoned ship on wednesday when cable giant comcast (nasdaq: cmcsa) announced it would make streaming boxes available for free to its broadband customers -- a move that could put it directly on a collision course with roku -- and driving the streaming-pioneer's stock down more than 14%.
comcast said in a press release that it would provide one free xfinity flex set-top box at no cost to subscribers of xfinity internet, which will give users access to more than 10,000 free movies and television shows while providing an easy way to access their premium streaming subscriptions from netflix (nasdaq: nflx), amazon.com's (nasdaq: amzn) prime video, hbo, and showtime. flex also gives customers a way to rent or purchase digital copies of their favorite shows and movies and provides access to their streaming-music choices like pandora, iheartradio and xite. other benefits of the flex service include access to available 4k ultra high definition (hd), from ad-free shows and movies to subscription streaming. additionally, customers can use comcast's voice-activated remote control to search for programs across the platform by simply using voice commands like "weather" or "watch game of thrones" into the remote.
comcast estimates that this will benefit millions of new and existing customers, giving them the ability to easily access all of their favorite streaming content.
this isn't the first whiff of competition that has come roku's way in recent weeks. at the ifa 2019 consumer electronics fair in berlin, amazon debuted more than 20 new fire tv edition devices. this is a major expansion of the fire tv ecosystem and its first major expansion in europe. amazon introduced the next-generation fire tv cube and a fire tv edition soundbar and is partnering with a number of major manufacturers on fire tv edition smart tvs.
this news came at the same time roku announced a licensing agreement to debut the first roku tv in the united kingdom, courtesy of hisense. the licensing of its smart tv operating system (os) has been a key part of roku's strategy to increase the number of active users on its platform -- and signaled the company's aspirations to continue that success in europe.
earlier this month, some roku investors decided to move to the sidelines after apple (nasdaq: aapl) announced that its apple tv+ streaming service would be priced at just $4.99, about half the price that many expected and free for a year to customers who purchase an apple device. this illustrates a basic misunderstanding on the part of roku shareholders, as the apple tv app will be available on roku devices, so it doesn't represent a threat. to understand how comcast's move will impact roku, it's important to look back at its recent results. roku grew revenue by 59% year over year in the most recent quarter, but the star of the show was its platform segment, which increased 86% as the result of increased advertising, a cut of subscriptions made via the platform, and licensing from its os. active accounts grew to 30.5 million, up 39% compared to the prior-year quarter. roku has been leveraging its user base to gradually increase the amount of advertising it shows across its platform, which accounts for much of its surging growth.
comcast's move to give away set-top boxes for free to its broadband customers could potentially eat into roku's account growth and stunt its future platform revenue. in the second quarter, comcast reported about 24.4 million residential broadband and 22.1 million cable tv customers. about 19 million comcast customers subscribe to two or more of the company's services, so there's a considerable amount of overlap -- meaning there will likely only be a few million potential users of the new flex box.
investors' knee-jerk reactions notwithstanding, this is clearly a move by comcast to tap into roku's most profitable business. by offering free programming (read "ad-supported"), the company hopes to increase its own advertising revenue by siphoning off some of roku's current and potential customers. in its most recent quarter, roku said that 1 in 3 smart tvs sold in the u.s. contained the roku os, giving the company a substantial base of user devices.
the most likely outcome of comcast's move is that ad-supported customers will follow the same path as those who pay for streaming video -- many get their entertainment from multiple providers.
all things considered, i don't think roku has much to worry about.

apple (nasdaq:) is still arguably the best company on the planet. they have accomplished amazing things in spite of a lot of criticism of tim cook's leadership. i personally don't believe that he's the best person for the job, but that doesn't stop me from betting bullish on the apple stock every chance i get.
 in early june, i wrote about an opportunity to go long aapl and it delivered a 20% rally and $30 per share upside. and more recently i was lucky to profit from smaller rallies. so check emotions at the door and let charts and fundamentals be the guides for the aapl stock.
the outcome of this week's market action is binary because of today's fed decision on rates. this also will also temporarily affect the aapl but eventually the fundamentals will retake the reins. the fed won't change aapl's 2019 thesis.
fundamentally, it is easy to argue for owning aapl stock. wall street systemically undervalues it. aapl sells at 19 trailing p/e ratio which is about four times smaller than amazon (nasdaq:) and 40% cheaper than facebook (nasdaq:).
however, this alone is not reason to expect higher prices because short of a miracle, investors will continue to undervalue the apple stock. but technically there is reason to expect much higher prices soon. it is on a path to reaching $245 per share. this would be a natural extension from its rally that started last christmas.
off last year's correction, aapl stock rallied 50%. then it gave back almost half it in the april correction -- but this is normal price action. bullish waves usually unfold in three pushes. first, the aapl buyers took it until they hit resistance at $213 per share. then, they corrected a bit and bounced off of the point of control of $172 per share. the third push, which is ongoing now should extend above $240 per share. there will be resistance at its last failing point at $226 per share.
this is all to say that if i am long apple stock, i stay long for at least another $15 upside opportunity from here. long term, if the stock market is higher in the future than so is apple. this is a money-making machine that will take more than an underwhelming ceo to break it.
the apple stock rally still has legs for many years to come. they are becoming less dependent on one product; the iphone is no longer the only headline that investors focus on. the services portion of the apple revenues is now gaining momentum. these are recurring revenues that make the company p&l less dependent on a single item release and updates. yes, the iphone is still important but much less so than a year ago. apple is finally adapting to the new way of doing business via subscription models rather than hardware pushes.
short term, there is a gap above in aapl to $223 per share from the silly goldman sachs headline from last week. but conversely, if aapl stock loses $217 per share, it could fall to fill the gap at $208 per share. the good news is that even if this happens, there is plenty of support there to keep it above $200 a share.
today's fed announcement might cause volatility, but my personal overall market thesis is that we will make new all-time highs soon. i expect fireworks this week, but if we dip there will be buyers to pick the pieces up and run higher. i still believe that there are too many bears who are too comfortable being short when markets are at all-time highs and when the global central banks are dedicated to inflating the economies.
they say do not fight the fed and do not fight the tape. so i don't see the reason to short stocks when both of these are true. so when we make new highs it will be a big bang where we will move a hundred points in the s&p 500 quickly. because when the last stops trigger, buying will beget buying and i want to be long apple stock into that event.

apple aapl is once again a $1 trillion company, joining microsoft msft, with shares up 8% in the past month. the tech giant's shares have also jumped over 5% this week as wall street seems pleased with apple's latest round of iphones and its streaming tv plans.
apple unveiled its newest iphones at its now customary pre-holiday shopping season event on tuesday, led by ceo tim cook and other top executives. the firm showed off three new iphones, under the new 11 branding.
the smartphones feature apple's somewhat standard updates, which include better battery life and faster processors. what separates the two new higher-priced smartphones (iphone 11 pro & 11 pro max: starting at $999) from their less expensive peer (iphone 11: starting at $699), is a triple-camera system. apple also dropped the price of last year's iphone xr by 20% ($599), with the iphone 8 starting at $449.
consumers might be more prone to buy the higher-end iphone 11s because the price points roughly match last year's new high-end models--after years of rising prices. perhaps more importantly, the new iphone 11 base model is actually $50 cheaper than last year's comparable offering. clearly, apple wants to give consumers every reason possible to upgrade to new phones after a year of poor iphone sales, especially since there is nothing earth-shattering about the new phones.
apple tv+ & services wall street, investors, and apple fans have waited for more details on apple's foray into the streaming tv world for months. they now have all they can hope for until they get to use the streaming service for the first time on november 1--disney+ debuts on nov. 12. anyone who buys a new iphone, ipad, mac, or other qualifying devices will get a year worth of apple tv+ for free. the service will otherwise cost $4.99 per month, after a seven-day free trial and be available on the apple tv app.
apple's streaming tv offering is clearly priced to move, as it comes in well below hbo go's t $14.99 per month, netflix's nflx $15.99 premium plan, amazon amzn prime's $12.99--which comes with shipping perks--and disney+ at $6.99. aside from trying not to force users into a decision between apple+ or netflix, the price-point represents how little content will be available at launch.
apple tv+ will feature roughly 10 shows at launch, including a fictional space race-era show called for all mankind, a show starring jennifer aniston, reese witherspoon, and steve carell titled the morning show, and post-apocalyptic drama see. apple will then slowly build up its library of shows, which is set to feature more a-list hollywood stars both in front of and behind the camera. the iphone maker is also likely viewing apple tv+ as a kind of loss-leader for now, since it reportedly spent roughly $15 million an episode to make see.
apple is making a long-term play to convert more of its roughly 1 billion hardware users into services customers. this business, which includes its app store, spotify spot challenger apple music, a monthly magazine-heavy news service, and an apple credit card, will also soon feature apple arcade. the company's big push into the video game world will feature access to roughly 100 titles for $4.99 per month and launch on september 19. apple hopes to grab a piece of the $68.5 billion global mobile game market.
the ongoing u.s. and china trade war spooked some apple investors early, but cook has been in constant contact with president trump and its biggest products have remained untouched. plus, the last few days have seen both china and the u.s. slightly change their tunes as the two sides prepare to meet once again in a few weeks.
apple's iphone sales did slip in each of the last three quarters, as did the firm's greater china revenue. the company has found it harder to sell its higher-priced smartphones in a market with so many less expensive options available.
meanwhile, iphone sales slipped on the back of hard to compare periods, which means a 2020 turn around could be in store. in fact, apple's sales popped 1% last quarter (q3 fiscal 2019) after revenue slipped 5.1% in q2 and 4.5% in q1. q4 outlook & beyond looking ahead, apple's fourth-quarter 2019 revenue is projected to slip 0.56% from the year-ago period to $62.55 billion, based on our zacks consensus estimates. this, however, comes against q4 2018's 20% top-line expansion. overall, aapl's full-year fiscal 2019 revenue is projected to dip 2.7% to reach $258.28 billion.
apple's first quarter 2020 revenue, which includes the key holiday shopping period, is expected to jump 1.5% to $85.54 billion. peeking further ahead, aapl's fiscal 2020 revenue is projected to climb 3.8% above our 2019 estimate to touch $268.01 billion and top 2018's figure.
at the bottom end of the income statement, apple is expected to see its q4 earnings sink 2.75%, with full-year 2019's eps figure set to fall 1.85%. then, apple's q1 2020 earnings are projected to surge 6.2% over the prior-year quarter, with full-year 2020 expected to come in 11.5% above our 2019 estimates.
along with apple's strong 2020 growth outlook, the firm has seen its earnings estimate revision picture trend heavily upward recently, especially for q4 and fiscal 2019. aapl is a zacks rank #3 (hold) at the moment that sports an "a" grade for momentum in our style scores system.
we can see that apple has traded at a higher forward price/sales ratio over the last year (4.2 vs. current 3.8). more importantly, apple is the only of the so-called faang stocks that pays a dividend. the company's current annualized dividend is $3.08 per share, for a 1.38% yield. this compares relatively favorably to the 10-year u.s. treasury note's 1.7%.
apple also has over $200 billion in cash on hand, which means it is likely to continue its massive buyback program. therefore, investors should consider aapl stock as a safe-haven investment, amid our current market uncertainty, with the added potential for big gains.

as was widely expected, the federal reserve lowered interest rates today by , but that wasn't enough to spark upside for equities. nor was it enough for president donald trump who criticized the fed for lacking "sense" and "vision" because it didn't lower rates by 50 basis points.
 three fed governors voted against today's rate cut, prompting some investors to express concern about the path forward.
"in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective," .
this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.
so today the nasdaq composite slipped 0.1% while the s&p 500 added just 0.03%. the dow jones industrial average gained 0.1%. in late trading, half of the dow stocks were pointed higher. the only sector in the u.s. that closed higher today was, unsurprisingly, utilities.
there weren't many dow winners today and among that small group, the gains were, well, small. one surprise was jpmorgan chase (nyse:). financial services stocks usually benefit from higher interest rates, and jpm and its rival banks have recently been complaining about the effects lower rates have on their net interest margins. in late trading jpm was the only financial services name in the dow trading higher.
another surprise, though of the disappointing variety, was merck (nyse:). this dow component barely nudged higher despite some encouraging news about its keytruda cancer treatment. regulators in australia, canada and the u.s. approved keytruda to treat advanced endometrial carcinoma.
this is significant news, but the stock barely moved higher today. hey, it's not everyday three major developed markets approve a cancer treatment on the same day.
"merck said regulators approved the use of keytruda with a drug called lenvima, discovered by the japanese company eisai (otcmkts:), to treat some instances of advanced endometrial carcinoma, a serious condition for which patients currently have few options," josh nathan-kazis wrote for barron's.
procter & gamble (nyse:) was a dow winner today, and like the others, it was in modest fashion. p&g is one of the dow's best-performing names this year. and some traders are getting bullish about options on the consumer goods giant's shares.
yes, apple (nasdaq:) has been making a lot of appearances here in recent days -- and the iphone maker is back today. wedbush released a note earlier today forecasting 185 million in iphone 11 shipments for fiscal 2020. analysts also wrote that pre-orders for the phone in the u.s. have been strong.
up nearly 8% this month, apple has been one of the best-performing dow stocks in september.
it's clear that market participants are focusing on the fed's division. however, because the central bank did not cut by 50 basis points today, it has another 25 basis point cut in its back pocket. chairman jerome powell overtly said that the fed can deploy more rate reductions if the economy sours, which he doesn't see happening right now.
speaking of the economy, the fed upped its 2019 gross domestic product forecast to growth of 2.2%. that's up slightly from . for now, the central bank is standing firm on its forecast of 2% gdp growth in 2020.
as of this writing, todd shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

make no mistake about it, the energy oil trade is a manipulated market. major entity organization of the petroleum exporting countries (opec) sets prices and production levels. this makes it difficult to trade energy stocks with confidence. but this is an aberration that i can use to my advantage to easily profit from them. today we examine the opportunities in energy select sector spdr fund (nysearca:), chevron (nyse:) and exxon mobile (nyse:) stocks.
it is amazing how often the experts are wrong on energy stocks trading. i have had consistent success simply trading their fundamentals and charts. what also helps is to acknowledge the fact that opec matters and they will keep crude oil prices inside the zone they need. when crude prices rise above $60, opec will bring it down so they don't lose market share. conversely, they prop prices up when they fall too far below $52 per barrel.
to successfully trade this notion i use mega-cap energy stocks like cvx and xom. or i use the etf xle instead since these two stocks make up almost half of the etf. when it comes to trading, they are the apple (nasdaq:) of the energy sector and carry little risk of failure.
if i cannot bet on them long-term with confidence then i should not be trading at all. these had upside potential in early july but they never triggered. for example, xom failed to break through $78 per share which left it vulnerable to the sharp correction that ensued. similar setups happened in cvx and xle.
trading xle stock has been difficult. it trails the s&p 500 and the united states oil fund, lp (nysearca:) by about 15%. clearly it has not been easy to bet on these stocks in spite of a healthy economy. but there is opportunity looming just above current prices.
first we have to make sure that the xle stock has a good base from which the bulls can spring. the good news is that it recently confirmed support at $56 as it bounced off of it into a 14% september rally. the bad news is, it now faces $64 per share which has been resistance. but therein lies the opportunity because breakouts often have to fail at their first face-off with resistance. nevertheless, onus is on the bulls to retest and break through resistance on subsequent tries.
once the xle rises above $64 then it can spring into a $5 rally from there. there will be resistance at $66, but with the right circumstances and market-wide momentum, xle stock can do it. it is important to note that $64 has been pivotal since 2006 so it will be sticky. this means that buyers and sellers love to fight over it and will likely continue to do so this time around.
of these three, cvx stock is my favorite. chevron stock bounced well off of its confirmed support at $114 per share from the august correction. luckily the bulls have almost erased the entire dip. from here the buyers are in control of the price action, however, they do have to contend with resistance above.
cvx stock has failed to break through the $126 per share resistance zone for over a year. this marked last october's accident scene, and the more recent failed attempts from march and july. in spite of that, if the bulls are persistent they can eventually break through the neckline and overshoot hired. the target from that would be a healthy extension of the current rally that could target $135 per share.
admittedly, i don't like to buy and hope that a rally unfolds. so in this case and since i have proven support, i would much rather sell downside risk into what others fear. this way i can create income without any out-of-pocket expense.
for example, i can sell the january cvx $110 put and collect $2 for it. as long as cvx stock stays above my level than i retain my maximum gains without needing a rally. in fact the stock has to fall 13% before i start losing money. worst case scenario is that i own cvx shares at $110 and accrue losses below $108 per share.
exxon mobil stock is similar to chevron but with slight variations. it is lagging cvx year-to-date by about six percentage points. moreover, it doesn't have the same clear confirmation of a bottom. yes, xom stock did bounce off a prior support level at $66, but the price pattern was different because of a failed attempt at $70 per share.
normally i would prefer selling downside risk as opposed to buying upside hopium. but xom has a clearer breakout opportunity than cvx. the neckline above seems easier to breach since it is so much farther from the october ledge. if xom closes above $75 per share it would trigger a buying program worth a $5 rally. it is important to wait for the breakout confirmation before chasing it. otherwise i'd be anticipating and hoping things go my way. this also means that i may miss out on a few bucks while i wait and that is o.k. in my book.
the general markets can make or break these potentials. xom and cvx are stocks of actual companies, so they will rally with the stock market indices regardless of oil status. the xle would follow in sympathy because these two comprise almost half of it.
there is also an element of surprise baked into the price of energy. the fact that saudi arabia suffered a drone attack builds up the anticipation fear of another one, meaning the price of oil has hidden support from this. fewer traders dare short it because of the possibility of such headlines for some time to come. we just saw oil spike almost 20% on this event so it will have lingering effect on traders.

for over a year now, i've looked at netflix (nasdaq: nflx) and its steep stock pullbacks multiple times, but i just haven't been able to bring myself to buy in.
it isn't the high valuation that's kept me away (even though the company sports a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 52), nor the torrid growth of expenses to stock up on and create content (a negative free cash flow of $594 million in the second quarter of 2019 alone). what's kept me from buying the dip is the history of the "early mover" business model -- and the inevitable shakeout that ensues when peers that were disrupted by the early mover strike back.
data by ycharts.
early movers and their shareholders often front the bill for new technology by testing and proving the efficacy of a new business model. i recently came across a rant from an early smart-home adopter furious that alphabet's google was unifying its device ecosystem, making support for some of its peers' smart-home devices a real headache. frustrating? you bet! but it's unfortunately what happens to early adopters of new tech. those quick to take up new ideas often get "guinea-pigged" and stuck with some of the bill for later mass adoption.
investors in new technology and business models are familiar with this, too. innovating companies need cash, and they often turn to selling stock and burning up the cash raised for a later payoff. sometimes this plays out in grandiose style, as with netflix and its massive returns since its initial public offering in 2002. amazon's early entrance into cloud computing, in the early 2000s, has also yielded huge sums of wealth for shareholders. other times, though, the payoff isn't quite the same: later businesses enter and disrupt the disruptors with more refined offerings, once the initial concept has had the kinks worked out. here are a few historical examples.
other examples abound, including the smartphone market, the current disruption in the cybersecurity space, and the responses of retailers like walmart and target to amazon. these examples might not be perfect analogies to the world of streaming, but they still illustrate the cycle of new business models and innovation.
with netflix pulling in millions of new subscribers -- mostly internationally at this point -- it's become clear that streaming tv is the future, and there's plenty of growth to be had. early netflix investors have been rewarded handsomely, but we are entering a period when the industry will go from essentially a few options to many, and the competitive landscape will be reshaped.
it could be easy to write off the mounting competition and say netflix will be fine, because it has enjoyed such a big head start in the world of streaming tv. but periods of industry transition like this can be bumpy, and the new entrants that netflix is fending off aren't start-ups. disney (nyse: dis) owns arguably some of the most recognizable and popular franchises ever, and while disney+ will only debut in three countries in november, it will roll out to other major markets over the next two years and will be bundled with hulu and espn+. apple tv+ is debuting in 100 countries right out of the gate in november. and comcast's (nasdaq: cmcsa) nbcuniversal streaming service could be a serious contender next year, with comcast controlling a significant presence in europe thanks to its sky acquisition last year. it's not even the competitive price tags on these other competing services: there are only so many hours in a day for consumers to be entertained and so much money in their monthly budgets for streaming subscriptions.
don't get me wrong, i'm not predicting the death of netflix -- or even that it will lose its leadership role in the streaming tv industry anytime soon. i'm just not ready to invest until the shakeout starts to take shape. at the very least, netflix no longer seems to have a real competitive advantage (as it obviously did over cable).
the company is still priced as if it's a cutting-edge pioneer and innovator -- the only game in town. the business model is starting to mature, and i'm not seeing enough innovation at netflix (creating original content is something everyone is pursuing) for me to get really excited right now. and the current valuation seems based on an assumption that netflix will continue as the only game in town for quite some time.
that's why i'm staying away from this stock and plan to do so until some of the heavy-hitting competing services come out and have some operating history under their belts. it's been an incredible run for netflix, but a breather -- at least a couple of years' worth -- is certainly in the cards.

when it comes to 5g stocks, i prefer a simple, elegant approach that has already proven itself in every other tech boom since the 1980s.
there will be a lot of winners in the race to 5g. for example, one stock that could be up big in the years ahead is nokia (nyse:), one of the key makers of the hardware critical to the technology.
but as 5g takes the world by storm and ushers in a new technological revolution, there's about to be a way bigger opportunity than we could capture by simply buying nokia stock. the infographic below shows how 5g compares to 4g... how that compared to 3g... and so on.
those nokia flip-phones had their heyday back at 1g and 2g. then 3g was what allowed apple (nasdaq:) to take the world by storm with the iphone. 4g made social media and streaming movies possible - you're welcome, facebook (nasdaq:) and netflix (nasdaq:).
as you see, 5g is much bigger. the speeds are so much faster that you could think of 5g as the fuel of the future.
so what's the engine? microchips. every company that sells you a 5g device first needs someone to supply the chips. 5g chips will send and receive massive amounts of data... and .
but actually, chipmakers are not just 5g stocks. they're almost always the secret to getting rich with new technologies. just look at the personal computer (pc) revolution, for example.
during the rise of pcs in the '80s and '90s, chipmakers went up by almost unfathomable amounts. intel (nasdaq:), which supplied the much-needed chips for computer processing speed, shot up by an astounding 7,951% from 1985 to 2000:
then, during the explosive growth of the internet in the 1990s, cisco systems (nasdaq:), which manufactures the vital processing chips for internet routers, soared an impressive 4,988%:
then came smartphones and 4g in the 2010s. as you see below, chipmakers led all other industries during the 4g build out. semiconductors returned 237% - more than twice what mobile phones themselves delivered.
keep in mind, these were returns from the broad sectors. but just look at how well these individual chip companies did during the smartphone build out:
it's also worth pointing out that apple -- the world's biggest, wealthiest company and one of the leaders in smartphones -- returned roughly 582% over that same period. the difference is why you need chipmakers when a tech revolution occurs. that's true of 5g, too, and i tell you exactly which chipmaker i recommend now (and why) in my new special report, .
by investing in chipmakers, you're investing in every laptop, tablet, car, smartphone, and any other electronic device of the day. in fact, each one has multiple chips inside! for example, one chipmaker supplied five chips for every iphone x. so, for every phone apple sold, this company sold five chips.
now just think about the hundreds of billions of new chips that will need to be created for the internet of things (iot). tech companies are hard at work, connecting every physical object on the planet to the internet. tech insiders estimate more than 1 trillion devices will be connected over the next 10 to 15 years.
once you're up to speed on , you'll want to own one specific chipmaker. this company is one of the best in the world at what it does, and i bet you've never heard of it.
i mention all this because i think this under-the-radar company won't stay that way for long. the financial media is already calling this company the company has over 10,000 patents and has been named a top 100 global innovator for seven consecutive years. its success has led to long-term partnerships and exclusive deals with the likes of samsung and oracle (nyse:).
even the 5g cell service from verizon (nyse:) and at&t (nyse:) will depend on this company's chips. everything, and i mean everything, connected to the internet via 5g will either directly or indirectly use the same type of chip this company makes.
it's also a well-established company that's been around since the 1990s. not only did it survive the dot-com crash, it went from a $2 billion market cap then... to a $17 billion market cap today. and thanks to its 5g advantage, it's just getting started.
 i think it's the single best (and easiest) way to capture the full upswing of 5g wireless.
remember, the rollout of 5g is going to be much bigger than 4g.
that's why every tech insider and analyst at my firm is excited about this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. and right now is the perfect time to stake a claim.

the apple (nasdaq: aapl) product launch on tuesday was packed with news. on the hardware front, the tech giant released the iphone 11, iphone 11 pro, and iphone 11 pro max; the apple watch series 5, and a new version of the entry-level ipad. but the tech company also shared more details on two of its upcoming services: apple arcade and apple tv+.
with the iphone segment accounting for over half of apple's revenue, it was no surprise that the company's latest versions were the main event for the keynote. but what was interesting is that it wasn't necessarily the flagship iphone that stole the show on tuesday. instead, it was the aggressive pricing of the new iphone 11 and the subsequent price cut to the current iphone xr that grabbed the spotlight.
here's a look at the newest iphones, and why the competitive pricing was a narrative that caught investors' attention.
the iphone 11. image source: apple.
as was the case last year, the lineup is made up of three new iphones: one lower-cost iphone and two high-end models. to differentiate the two higher-end smartphones from the cheapest new one, apple gave the more expensive models a "pro" designation this year.
iphone 11 (starting at $699): in many ways, this is the successor to the iphone xr that apple launched last year. priced lower than the iphone 11 pro and iphone 11 pro max, it is available in more colors, has a liquid crystal display (lcd) instead of the organic light-emitting diode (oled) version on the higher-end models, and has a display that measures 6.1 inches. setting it apart from the iphone xr, the new phone has a better camera, improved battery life, and apple's new a13 bionic processor.
iphone 11 pro (starting at $999): compared with the iphone 11, the iphone 11 pro has a smaller display size of 5.8 inches. but it has an oled display, and an even better camera system than the iphone 11. it also includes the latest a13 bionic chip.
iphone 11 pro max (starting at $1,099): the new flagship iphone replaces the iphone xs max. it is mostly the same as the iphone 11 pro but has a 6.5-inch display and five more hours of battery life compared with the iphone xs max, giving it the longest battery life of any iphone. while the iphone 11 certainly isn't cheap, it's notably priced $50 lower than the iphone xr's $749 starting price last year. perhaps even more surprising, apple dropped the price of its one-year-old iphone xr by $150, to $599.
the aggressive pricing could give the iphone segment a much-needed boost. its revenue has been declining, and iphone unit sales, which the company stopped reporting as they started to trend downward, are likely still falling as well.
as apple transitions to a business model that is focused on monetizing its base of active users with an increasingly robust slate of services, it makes sense to make its iphones more affordable. this could reinvigorate unit sales growth, which could ultimately bolster the company's installed base of active users, who it can monetize with apps and services in the coming years.

it's not a closely held secret that netflix (nasdaq: nflx) has set off a tv streaming and entertainment content war. on top of the offerings that are already out there, this november we will see the launch of disney's (nyse: dis) disney+ as well as apple's (nasdaq: aapl) tv+, all featuring cheap monthly price tags to lure in subscribers.
it may be arriving a bit late to the party, but comcast's (nasdaq: cmcsa) nbcuniversal just officially announced its take on the burgeoning internet-delivered television market: peacock. don't write it off as just another imitation service, though. peacock has some actual potential to take off.
peacock is due to launch in april 2020. anyone who's ever tuned in to an nbc broadcast will recognize the name as a nod to the company's peacock logo. as management had been hinting, there will be ad-supported and ad-free subscription versions for consumers to choose from. no word yet on pricing, although it's fair to guess that it will want to be competitive if it expects to do well against disney+ at just $6.99 a month and apple tv+ at $4.99 a month.
peacock is already lining up new tv and movie content from big hollywood names, live event coverage like the 2020 summer olympics, and popular classic tv sitcom titles like the office, parks and recreation, 30 rock, monk, and frasier, just to name a few. other drama and sci-fi series like the battlestar galactica (both the classic series and a new reboot), friday night lights, and house will also be available. some 3,000 hours of content from nbc's telemundo spanish network will also stream on peacock. no word yet on how widely distributed the service will be beyond the u.s., although it could reach far given that comcast also owns sky broadcasting in europe and the u.k.
rather than just a "hey, i want in too" service, peacock could actually be a compelling option for consumers. while market-leading netflix subscribers in the u.s. have -- at least for the moment -- stalled out at about 60 million, ad-supported internet tv could push the number of people cutting cable and making the switch to streaming far higher in the next few years. far less expensive than cable, the only other requirement besides a single-digit monthly bill is a few minutes of endurance through commercials if you opt for that version of the service. who can argue with that?
nbcuniversal isn't just stocking peacock with new tv series, movies, and live events; it has a deep reservoir of old content, too. according to polls conducted by nielsen, consumer familiarity with content matters -- quite a bit, actually. according to the pollster, the availability of shows viewers used to watch on broadcast tv ranks as the top reason for choosing a streaming service.
it's why netflix has been in bidding wars with the old guard in entertainment for content distribution rights. for example, netflix lost the office to comcast but likely paid hundreds of millions for the global rights to seinfeld. it's likely that consumers will ultimately subscribe to multiple services to get everything they want (disney is betting on that by offering a bundle package with disney+, hulu, and espn+). but at some point, consumers will start making tough decisions. the ease with which a streaming service can be turned on and off will produce subscriber turnover and will also put a cap on pricing power.
as a new entrant to the tv streaming wars, comcast is set to be a disruptor that benefits from the trend. over the long term, though, the amount of competition out there will set a limit on how many subscribers peacock is able to muster and how profitable it inevitably will be.
it's important to remember that while nbcuniversal is getting lots of attention, comcast's bread and butter is its cable internet segment, headlined by xfinity. cable services generated 52% of revenues through the first half of 2019, but the segment generated two-thirds of adjusted ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization).
while broadcasting and other sources of tv revenue have been performing solidly, peacock could be a nice bolt-on addition for the nbcuniversal segment, increasing viewership of its properties and thus growing ad revenue -- not to mention creating a small but stable stream of income from peacock subscriptions. however, at the end of the day, nbcuniversal ultimately takes a back seat to cable. and that's what makes peacock a small potential value enhancer for comcast shareholders but a potentially deadly new entrant for netflix, which relies solely on the fate of internet tv viewership. the same goes for disney+ and apple tv+. the verdict's out, and it will likely take at least a few quarters of operating history to determine how peacock and its peers will disrupt the tv-viewing landscape.
full disclosure if you haven't already guessed: my chips are on comcast, disney, and apple at the moment, and i do not own netflix.
one thing's for sure, though: the consumer is winning. home entertainment options are getting more plentiful and cheaper by the dozen.

apple (nasdaq: aapl) ceo tim cook didn't waste any time kicking off the company's keynote presentation on tuesday morning. while the main focus of the annual september product launch is usually the iphone, cook first provided some updates on two of the tech giant's upcoming services: apple arcade and apple tv+.
while the tech company announced apple arcade and apple tv+ alongside two other new services -- apple news+ and apple card -- earlier this year, it hadn't provided many details about the video game and television subscription services until now. on tuesday, apple revealed both services' prices, launch dates, and other details.
here's what you should know.
apple arcade is a subscription service that gives users unlimited access to a library of games. the service, apple announced, will cost $4.99 a month and will come with a one-month free trial. this price is for individual subscribers or a family of up to six members.
initially, the game will include a catalog of over 100 games and will be available in more than 150 countries.
apple's streaming-tv service, apple tv+, is launching on nov. 1. the new, ad-free subscription service will be offered in over 100 countries and will feature original shows, movies, and documentaries. some of the new shows available on the service's first day include the morning show, starring reese witherspoon, jennifer aniston, and steve carell; dickinson, a story about a rebellious young poet; and see, a drama starring jason momoa and alfre woodard.
the new service will cost $4.99 a month and include a seven-day free trial. in addition, customers who purchase a new iphone, ipad, apple tv, ipod touch, or mac will get one year of free access to apple tv+. like the apple arcade subscription, up to six family members can be included in a single subscription.
more new original shows will be added to the app each month, apple said.
competition in streaming tv has been heating up. walt disney (nyse: dis) is launching its streaming service on nov. 12 for just $6.99 a month. the new service, called disney+, will include new originals, as well as access to pixar, marvel, star wars, disney movies, and more. in addition, disney announced a $12.99-per-month bundle that will include access to disney+, espn+, and hulu.
it's no surprise to see apple pricing its services aggressively. the company likely wants to ensure it grabs market share in these new categories quickly, as services are becoming an increasingly important pillar to apple's business. services revenue in the company's most recent quarter increased 13% year over year. this compares to apple's 1% growth in its consolidated top line over the same time frame. in addition, it was a record quarter for the company's services business.

david and tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and apple wasn't one of them! that's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.

roku (nasdaq: roku) stock plummeted after comcast (nasdaq: cmcsa) announced its internet subscribers are now eligible to receive a free xfinity flex streaming box and facebook (nasdaq: fb) introduced its new portal tv device. investors are worried that new competitors entering the market with even a modicum of differentiation -- comcast on price, facebook on technology -- could negatively impact roku's future. in other words, investors think roku doesn't have any real competitive advantages.
roku has faced considerable competition for a long time. apple (nasdaq: aapl) released the first version of apple tv before the first roku device went on sale. amazon (nasdaq: amzn) entered the market in 2014 and has been extremely aggressive in its efforts to grab market share since. still, roku is the leading streaming platform in the u.s. by most measures, and it's rapidly increasing total engagement on the platform.
that's because it has some things its competitors don't. here's what comcast and facebook are missing in their effort to compete with roku.
roku ceo anthony wood is a fan of saying his company is agnostic when it comes to what content you want to stream. by comparison, apple wants users to watch itunes, apple tv+, and apple tv channels. amazon wants users to stream prime video.
comcast will likely push its forthcoming peacock streaming service, as well as tv everywhere apps that require cable authentication. what's more, you're locked into comcast's internet service. that means if you move or switch internet service providers, you won't be able to keep using your device. and considering the new competition expected to enter the home internet market over the next few years, that lock-in could have a significant impact on a consumer discretionary spending decisions.
facebook is the least agnostic, as it still puts a focus on facebook watch videos in its marketing. the social giant's portal tv is also heavily focused on pushing users to its messaging apps, messenger and whatsapp, which provide the back end for its core video-calling feature.
that said, roku now offers users the roku channel, an ad-supported channel of licensed and third-party content where it sells premium subscriptions as well. the roku channel has become an integral piece of roku's strategy to grow platform revenue through additional ad sales and potentially better margins on its distribution of premium streaming services.
for consumers looking for a simple streaming experience that doesn't sway behavior toward one bucket of content or another, roku is still the best choice. new competitors looking to enter the market will likely suffer from a similar dilemma, as companies seem to be pushing competing hardware as a means to sell something else (like a video subscription). roku's level of agnosticism is unparalleled.
roku has 30.5 million active users, mostly in the united states. not only that, but its users spend a lot of time streaming video on its platform -- nearly 3.5 hours per day. that level of broad engagement is highly attractive to content providers.
facebook is notably launching portal tv without support for netflix. in fact, the options for streaming video are very limited compared to competing streaming devices. comcast, meanwhile, has more streaming video options (thanks to its position as a distributor for traditional media and several over-the-top services already). it also has an easy path to scale by including its flex device with an internet subscription. but even if literally every one of comcast's 27.8 million high-speed internet customers started using flex devices, it still wouldn't catch up to roku's user base, and engagement would likely be significantly lower.
it's also worth noting that millions of roku users have more than one roku device. the company has 41 million installed devices in the united states, according to an estimate from strategy analytics. indeed, many households have multiple television sets, and it'd be nice to be able to stream video to all of them. comcast limits households to two flex devices and charges customers $5 per month to lease the second device. facebook's portal tv costs $149, although customers buying two can get a $50 discount. roku offers one of the most economical ways of streaming video to all televisions, which increases engagement. as such, big households will likely opt for roku as their streaming device of choice.
roku's highly engaged user base combined with the fact that it doesn't favor any one streaming service over others makes it a necessary distribution channel for new over-the-top video options. that creates a virtuous cycle where users opt for roku for access to the broadest selection of content. that's the network effect in action, and it's one of the strongest competitive advantages in developing a platform business like roku's.
