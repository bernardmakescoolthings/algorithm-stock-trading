The program will takes a csv from Yahoo finance (Download full History if Possible). 

The program will loop through the whole csv in chronological order buying and selling
if it has decided the technical analysis indicators are in its favor. 

The program is not day trading. The program will simulate buying a stock, holding it
for the target period and then selling at the close of that day.

                the target day.

arg4 - Start Date - Date in format year-month-day   if single digit, add 0. 
                    Input as 0 to start at earliest possible time
